# Spirograph
Tracing out the path followed by a moon orbiting a planet (and then, the path of a moon orbiting that moon) to generate some interesting geometric designs.

The truly breathtaking thing about this spirograph is that, given enough "moons", we could emulate *any two-dimensional path* (if we also vary the orbit radii and rotation speeds). This is the deep and moving insight behind Fourier transformations. See for instance this magical [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVuU2YCwHjw).

## Next Steps:
- [ ] Let users input parameters for radii and rotation speed to change the pattern.
- [ ] Connect this animation to Fourier transformations.
